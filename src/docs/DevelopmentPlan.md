    level: number
    experience: number
    questsCompleted: number
  }
}

// Character Model
{
  id: ObjectId
  userId: ObjectId
  name: string
  class: string
  attributes: {
    strength: number
    intelligence: number
    dexterity: number
    // etc.
  }
  specialPowers: Power[]
  inventory: Item[]
  story: {
    currentChapter: number
    decisions: Decision[]
    relationships: NPC[]
  }
}

// Story Model
{
  id: ObjectId
  characterId: ObjectId
  genre: string
  chapters: Chapter[]
  currentState: {
    location: string
    activeQuests: Quest[]
    availableChoices: Choice[]
  }
  history: StoryEvent[]
}
\`\`\`

### B. API Structure
1. **Authentication**
   - /api/auth/sign-up
   - /api/auth/sign-in
   - /api/auth/sign-out

2. **Character Management**
   - /api/characters/create
   - /api/characters/[id]/update
   - /api/characters/[id]/powers

3. **Story Management**
   - /api/stories/create
   - /api/stories/[id]/progress
   - /api/stories/[id]/choices
   - /api/stories/[id]/save
   - /api/stories/[id]/load

4. **Game Progress**
   - /api/progress/quests
   - /api/progress/achievements
   - /api/progress/stats

### C. AI Integration
1. **Story Generation**
   - Context management
   - Choice generation
   - Character dialogue
   - Scene description

2. **Visual Asset Selection**
   - Scene analysis
   - Sprite selection
   - Environment matching
   - Special effects triggers
